## Hi there 👋

# I'm Jay Mar, a full-stack developer based in Philippines.

# I build web/desktop application.

# I always integrate/introduced nuget packages/tools/libraries based on the application requirements.

# My main tech stack is C#/.Net, javascript, jquery, and bootstrap. My favorite tools are postman(API testing), visual studio(main IDE), draw.io app(flowchart maker), and github desktop(version control).

# I have built over 20 private repositories.
