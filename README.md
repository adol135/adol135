# Hi there 👋

### I'm Jay Mar, a full-stack developer based in Philippines.

### I built in-house and public web/desktop application.

### I always integrate nuget packages/tools/libraries based on the application requirements.

### My main tech stack is C#/.Net, OraclePLSQL, MySQL, javascript, jquery, and bootstrap.

### My favorite tools are postman(API testing), visual studio(main IDE), Toad(SQL IDE), draw.io app(flowchart maker), and github desktop(version control).

### I have built over 20 private repositories.
